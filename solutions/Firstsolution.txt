there is a  possible strategy to ensure everyone gets to drink could involve the following steps:

Establish a Turn Order: Agree on a sequence in which guests will place their cups on the table. This prevents chaos and ensures everyone knows when it's their turn.

Form Groups of Three: Divide the N guests into groups of three. If N is not a multiple of three, the remaining one or two guests can form a final group with the host.

Sequential Pouring: For each group of three:

The three guests place their cups on the table in a row.
The host fills the first and last cups.
The guests whose cups are filled drink the water.
The middle guest waits for the next round.
Rotate Positions: After each round, rotate the positions so that each guest has the opportunity to be in the first or last position, ensuring they eventually receive water.

Repeat Until All Have Drunk: Continue this process, ensuring that after a few rounds, every guest has had the chance to drink.

This strategy promotes fairness and ensures that all guests get to drink, while adhering to the rules you've set. It's crucial to establish clear communication and cooperation among the guests to prevent any misunderstandings or dishonest behavior that could lead to a deadlock.
